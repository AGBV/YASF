## Command Line Interface (Work in progress)

For those not familiar with the Python programming language, `YASF` provides a command line interface (CLI) to interact with the framework. The CLI is still in internal testing and will be provided in the future.

The CLI will allow users to run simulations without writing any Python code. The CLI will be able to read input files and write output files, as well as provide a simple interface to run simulations.

## API

The Python API is outlined in our [API documentation](reference/).
Please visit our [examples](/getting-started/examples.md) page for an outline of examples provided in the repository.
