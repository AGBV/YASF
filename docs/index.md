# Welcome to YASF

`YASF` is a Python implementation of the [`Celes`](https://github.com/disordered-photonics/celes) framework (based on [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com/)) and extends its functionality by providing optical parameters, similar to [`MSTM`](https://github.com/dmckwski/MSTM) (based on [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/)).
