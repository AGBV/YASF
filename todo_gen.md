# TODO
As of 01.07.2022. yasf only implements the celes functionality until the calculation of the scattering coefficients.
These are needed for the new `optics` class to calculate parameters found in [MSTM](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~dmckwski/scatcodes/){:target="_blank"}.
Expanding the functionality of yasf and improving its code base will be tracked in the TODO list here.
In the future, if needed, this will be presented more like a roadmap :)

- [x] Create pages for the documentation
- [x] Complete the documentation of the code
- [ ] Orient the created documentation around the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/){:target="_blank"} framework

## Source List
**This is an auto-generated list of TODOs in the codebase.**

- [parameters.py:85](https://github.com/AGBV/YASF/blob/main//home/mar/Development/YASF/yasfpy/parameters.py#L85): do all the idx to value conversion here
- [particles.py:44](https://github.com/AGBV/YASF/blob/main//home/mar/Development/YASF/yasfpy/particles.py#L44): Keep it for now, remove later...
- [simulation.py:123](https://github.com/AGBV/YASF/blob/main//home/mar/Development/YASF/yasfpy/simulation.py#L123): new, could be error prone and is not tested yet!
