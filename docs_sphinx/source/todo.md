# TODO

As of 01.07.2022, YASF only implements the CELES functionality until the calculation of the scattering coefficients.
These are needed for the `optics` class to calculate parameters found in MSTM.

Expanding the functionality of YASF and improving its code base is tracked here.

- [x] Create pages for the documentation
- [x] Complete the documentation of the code
- [ ] Orient the created documentation around the Diátaxis framework
