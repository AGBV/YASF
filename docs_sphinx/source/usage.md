# Usage

## Command Line Interface (work in progress)

For those not familiar with the Python programming language, YASF provides a command line interface (CLI) to interact with the framework.
The CLI is still in internal testing and will be provided in the future.

The CLI is intended to allow users to run simulations without writing Python code:
- Read input files
- Write output files
- Provide a simple interface to run simulations

## API

The Python API is outlined in the [API documentation](api.md).

Please also check the [examples](examples.md) section for runnable examples in this repository.
