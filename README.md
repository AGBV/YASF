# Yet Another Scattering Framework
YASF is T-Matrix implementation in python based on the Matlab framework [CELES](https://github.com/disordered-photonics/celes) developed by [Egel et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02145).

# Development
This repository is still under development!
After the baseline has been finilized, the implementation will be available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) as a package to be downloaded using pip.

# Documentation
The code is documented using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you discover mistakes, feel free to create a pull request or open up an issue.
